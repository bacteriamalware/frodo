\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we present a thorough evaluation of the NIST post-quantum standardization candidate \textsf{FrodoKEM}  on embedded devices. We have developed an FPGA implementation that fits into 2000 slices on a low-cost Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. The FPGA implementation for a security level of 128 bits needs 60 ms to run a full key exchange and 135 ms for a security level of 192 bits. We also developed a ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller implementation that needs 836 ms to perform a full run of the protocol for 128 bits of security and 1.84 s for 192 bits of security. Our implementations are compatible with the reference implementation and we covered all implementations options given in the specification, i.e. we implemented both parameter sets and both PRNG options. Our results show the efficiency of \textsf{FrodoKEM} and help to assess the practical performance of a possible future post-quantum standard.

For future work it would be interesting to further analyze to side-channel resistance of our implementation and the cost of applying countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Our implementations are protected against timing attacks as they have a constant execution time, but more sophisticated attacks, like differential power analysis or fault attacks are not covered in this work. Furthermore, we only applied those optimizations to the memory usage that did not have a sizeable impact on the performance. It would be interesting to know the performance cost of getting the scheme running on even smaller microcontrollers, like a Cortex-M0, that have even less memory accessible.
