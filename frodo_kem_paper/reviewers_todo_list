TODO list from FrodoKEM --- done marked as (+++), not done marked as (---)

========================================================================

Reviewer 1 (not a reject)

NOTES:
1. downplay the security of lattice-based schemes.
2. compare, algorithmically, to newhope so the results can be analysed easily.
3. add results of the sub-modules from the FPGA designs.

REVIEW:
This work seems to be the first implementation of FrodoKEM, targeting
at FPGAs and microcontrollers.  It is exciting to practical
evaluations of FrodoKEM, a submissions to NIST PQC standardization,
within several months after NIST round 1 announcements.  Simple
side-channel resistance is built into the implementations. Indeed,
further techniques such as differential power analysis are more
complicated to conduct due to little SNR on the multiplication
instructions.  However, prior DPA attacks targeting on multipliers do
exist and the authors might have discussed it further.

---The results are not very encouraging for the ARM Cortex M4 platform.
The latency of the author's ARM implementation is about 120 times
worse comparing to Ring-LWE-based scheme New Hope.  Although it is
a common belief that LWE-based scheme would be slower than
RLWE-based scheme, Frodo is only around 10 times slower than
New Hope or Kyber in other platforms (including the NEON and AVX2
implementation[1][2][3] and the FPGA implementation in this same paper).

+++I do find the claim that, "lattice-based cryptography benefits from
the strong security notion of worst-case to average-case hardness,
meaning average-case instances are at least as hard as worst-case
instances of related lattice problems" to be a serious oversell.
Please insert a "(much smaller)" after "related".  I believe that
there is no current set of parameters proposed where the security
reduction theorems yield a "proven" security level assuming that we do
not make a breakthrough on lattice problems.

Moreover, given that FPGA and microcontroller implementations are much
slower than (say) NewHope, an explanation is surely in order.   It is
acceptable to state that the intrinsic complexity of the two algorithms
are different.  Nevertheless, pure qualitative explanations on the issue
seems insufficient. It is strongly urged to add a comparative survey on
previous work discussing, say, the algorithmic difference between
FrodoKEM and NewHope.  Comparing and explaining the ratio gives a more
persuasive evidence on the performance loss.

Editorially:

A simple but clear block diagram depicts the architecture
of the FPGA implementation. The thorough analysis on memory also
reduces the usage to the least possible level. However, it would have
made the text more complete to add the resource utilization report for
sub-modules.  Readers may then have a better insight on the proportion
taken by different blocks.

By the way, there is a "TODO" in line 1 of page 8.

Reviewer 2 (not a reject)

NOTES:
1. more detail is needed in the fpga sections to distinguish the differences between keygen, encaps, and decaps.
2. consider making the title less generic.
3. downplay the side channel resistence more.
4. comment regarding AS' and S'A is confusing, the computation is _always_ S'A so maybe the reviewer has misread something?

REVIEW:
The paper provides both FPGA and ARM implementations of FrodoKEM. Unlike other
KEM schemes, Frodo does not rely on Ideal lattices. Consequently, there is a
fundamental drop in performances compared to Ideal lattice-based schemes, but
with a higher confidence regarding post-quantum security at this point.
Regarding implementation results, authors observe a slow-down of 1 order of
magnitude on FPGA, and 2 orders of magnitude on ARM compared to the
ideal-lattice scheme NewHope.

Main remarks:
The contribution of the paper is fair, however the implementation results are
not particularly attractive because they are compared to Ideal-lattices. At
this point, there is no particular attacks regarding ideal-lattices, but there
is no guarantee that the specific structure cannot be exploited in the
future.
The only concern I have is about FPGA implementation, which I think lacks
precision regarding the distinction between
Kegen/encapsulation/decapsulation.

Additional remarks:
- The title is not indicative enough of the paper content, as the paper only
focuses on FrodoKEM.
- Section 2.5: “To be resistant against side-channel attacks, the sampler
iterates over the entire table D ...” -> A constant time behavior only
provides some counter-measures regarding timing attacks, but the fact that the
computation time is well-know (for the attacker), the synchronization of an
attacker regarding side channel leakage (power consumption, EM,...) is also
greatly
simplified. Thus, I would be more conservative regarding this sentence.
- Regarding the computation of AS’ (encapsulation) and S’A (decapsulation)
in FPGA: I understand why A can be computed on-the-fly for the product AS’,
but it is not how S’A has been computed with the proposed architecture. Are
there two independent designs, one for the encapsulation, the other for
decapsulation? If not, how do you manage both computations in the same
architecture?
- Section 4.4 : Same remark than 2).

Minor remark:
- Line 229: There is a remaining "TODO".

Reviewer 3 (maybe an accept)

NOTES:
1. This reviewer has mainly editorial comments, suggesting a "polish" before publication:

REVIEW:
+++Keywords: avoid capitalization for non-proper nouns.
+++Line 32: should use generic examples such as ECC instead of DSA/ECDSA.
+++Line 43: "involves very simple..."
+++Line 70: "Another design rationale for Frodo is simplicity,...".
+++Line 71: the statement "more efficient in comparison to NewHope" is
problematic here. Maybe, the authors mean to say that Frodo's parameter sets
are more flexible, easier to scale and support simpler implementations.
+++Line 77: "little effort has been spent on researching the feasibility of
FrodoKEM on embedded devices". AFAIK there are no studies on this subject, so
you can claim to be the first effort in researching the feasibility of
FrodoKEM on embedded devices. This needs to be differentiated from
implementations of similar, yet different, standard lattice-based encryption
schemes like [HMO+16]. Accordingly, Line 87 should be adjusted to "Previous
work on the evaluation of ...".  
+++Line 84: "while not deteriorating..."
+++Line 99: "mathematical problems other than lattices..."
+++Line 114: "where the remaining operations..."
+++Line 116: what is said in the previous sentences that guarantee the execution
in constant-time? Answer: this has now been made more explicit. Each multiplication takes 1 clock cycle, and the runtime of each operation takes exactly the number of required multiplications, the remaining operations run in parallel. 
---Section 1.2: should mention details of targeted platforms when giving explicit
timings and resource usage (e.g., FPGA model and ARM processor, including
operating frequency details).
---Line 172: that the pk is added to the sk is due to a constraint in the API
designated by NIST, which does not allow to pass pk separately to the
decapsulation function (so this doesn't have anything to do with the CCA
security).
+++Line 183: Frodo -> FrodoKEM, for the two cases in the line.
+++Line 203: "to be resistant against timing side-channel attacks" (maybe, simple
side-channel attacks can also be included here).
+++Line 229: there is a "TODO" there. Does the description in those lines
correspond to what is currently implemented and reported? Answer: Yes, we implement vector-matrix multiplication, instead of matrix-matrix multiplication.
+++Line 396: discus -> discuss 
+++Section 5.1: how is it possible that the choice of AES or cSHAKE does not
affect the cycle count? please explain. Answer: line added "This module runs in parallel to the LWE multiplication core and is thus not apart of the critical path and the clock cycle counts of the operations." as well as improved description of Table 3 "In Table 3 we present..." for clarification.
+++Line 425: "the BRAM usage is significantly larger..."
Section 5.1: should mention somewhere the security reason for using a fresh
matrix A at each connection (relevant when comparing with [HMO+16]). Answer: Results section now includes a discussion on the reuse of randomness.
---Section 5.2: have you tried running the software at a smaller operating
frequency. Some Cortex-M4 based boards are known to vary (and improve) cycle
performance at smaller frequencies. For example, see

Reviewer 4 (accepted, after changes)

NOTES:
1. The first critism is on the pipelining of the FPGA LWE multiplier. The answer to this is "yes", but it's not as amazing as they're making it sound: the inputs are based on an always increasing address counter, like the previous work on standard-LWE.

2. It seems like the reviewer would like to see a non-parallelised version of the FPGA design, to compare this with the proposed design. I'm not sure why, I don't think I've seen this in any other crypto/FPGA paper...

3. The reviewer has a comment on the largest operation in FrodoKem-976 decaps. It's hard to say which line in the algorithm they're referring to, but in general: each vector-matrix mulitplication is an accumulation of 15-by-15-bits, 460 times, which is well within the 48-bit accumulator in the DSP and is obviously within the 25-by-18-bit multiplier. Increasing the parameters here only really increases the number of accumulations, hence the small-ish increase in area consumption.

4. The reviewer is correct, the cSHAKE component takes up ~1685 flip-flops (2.7k LUTs / 0.7k slices) and we use two cSHAKEs in the design.

REVIEW: This paper describes two implementations of the post-quantum proposal
FrodoKEM: one on FPGA and the other on microcontrollers.  FrodoKEM's main
operations are generated a large matrix uniformly at random; generating a
medium-sized matrix of Gaussians; and multiplying the two together.

A major challenge in embedded implementations of Frodo is its large memory
usage, because it involves eg a 976x976 x 976x8 matrix multiplication at
16-bit precision.  Naively this would use almost 2MB of RAM, but generating
the large matrix on the fly can reduce the RAM usage significantly.  This
paper reduces the submission implementation's 192 kB of RAM by a factor of
about 3 by careful management of what is stored and what is generated on the
fly.

I have some trouble believing that the FPGA implementation of key generation
takes *exactly* 976*976*8 cycles, which is exactly the number of element
multiplications.  Are you counting throughput, and thus ignoring pipeline
latency?  Even so, is the core pipelined perfectly so that a second operation
can follow *immediately* after the first?  Achieving zero overhead would be
pretty interesting in itself.

For the FPGA design, I would have expected to see a parallel version of the
core as well as a completely serial one.  The largest operation (Frodo-976
decaps) uses 55 kilobytes of memory, which weighs hundreds of times more than
a 16x16 MAC unit.  The prospect of doubling (or quadding, or ...) the speed of
the computation with a few % area investment, and probably improving energy
efficiency as well, would be tempting for many ASIC customers.  This is
especially the case because Frodo isn't exactly fast in the first place.

It would also be interesting to see the breakdown of timing and area for the
different components: Gaussian sampler, control logic, cSHAKE etc.  This is
particularly important because, if other reports are anything to go by, cSHAKE
probably occupies almost a thousand slices on ARTIX-7, and it must certainly
take at least 1600 flip-flops since a RAM implementation would be too slow. 
That means that about half the logic area is only CSHAKE, so the multiplier
and Gaussian sampler are quite slim.  This is possible though, because the
multiplier is mostly just a DSP unit and some muxes.

This paper does not discuss side-channel attacks other than the timing
channel.

I would be interested to see the code size for the microcontroller
implementation as well as the RAM usage.

Overall, this paper is a somewhat unexciting implementation report, and it
seems not entirely baked.  It is especially unexciting because Frodo is
predictably quite slow, uses a lot of memory (though the authors have managed
to reduce this somewhat), and doesn't have many optimization opportunities. 
We certainly need implementation reports for the post-quantum standardization
effort.  Therefore I recommend that it be accepted after a revision to provide
more detail about the FPGA results, and perhaps a parallel implementation; or
eprinted or submitted to another journal.

Reviewer 5 (maybe an accept?)

NOTES:
1. There are a few editoral comments.

REVIEW:
This paper has two main contributions: a FPGA and an ARM implementations of
FrodoKEM, a (general)d lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism submitted to
NIST post-quantum standardization effort. FrodoKEM is a very interesting
candidate because it does not use ring-LWE but the plain LWE problem. Both
implementations implement the four parameters of FrodoKEM (dimensions 640 or
976, AES or SHAKE) and are running in constant time. The FPGA part is quite
succinct and the ARM section is quite complete. This is a nice contribution
that merits publication at CHES.

Remarks:
- The paper should be careful about using Frodo versus FrodoKEM (cf. abstract:
Frodo is not a submission to NIST, FrodoKEM is...; see Tables; see line 95 and
others), and which version of NewHope it is talking about. I would recommend
to revisit EVERY time such schemes are mentioned and ALWAYS specify which
version you are talking about.
- Table 4 should indicate that it is the cSHAKE variant. More generally, the
Frodo mentioned does not exist: the actual names include either AES or cSHAKE
- Table 7 is quite incomplete. What about the other FrodoKEM? WHat about
Kyber768 that comes by default in pqmu for CortexM4?
- [DucasDurmusLepointLyubashevsky'13] should probably be cited line 59
- line 156: it's not "high enough parameters": there is a quite complex
balance between q and n
- line 229: there is a TODO
+++l263-264: what is an anonymous Gaussian? It's not Gaussian by the way, just
close to a Gaussian. Answer: sentence changed and references to Gaussians changed to error distribution instead.
